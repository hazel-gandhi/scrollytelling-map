# Scrollytelling Map

A map showing the industries in Shelby County in Memphis, Tennessee, that account for the highest HAP and CAP emissions in the area.

The data for this story is from the [2020 National Emissions Inventory (NEI)](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/national-emissions-inventory-nei) released by the EPA.

The purpose of this project was to create a custom scrollytelling map and the template used was from [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling).
